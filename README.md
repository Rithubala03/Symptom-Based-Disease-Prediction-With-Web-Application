The Symptom Prediction System is an innovative web application designed to
 assist users in predicting potential diseases based on the symptoms they input.
 Leveraging a machine learning-based approach, the system employs the Support
 Vector Classifier (SVC) algorithm, trained on a comprehensive dataset of diseases
 and their associated symptoms, enabling accurate classification and mapping of
 user-reported symptoms to probable diseases, thus enhancing diagnostic accuracy.
 Users interact with the application through an intuitive Flask web interface, where
 they can easily input their symptoms. Once submitted, the symptoms are
 processed and passed to the SVC model for prediction in a seamless manner. The
 system not only predicts potential diseases but also retrieves a wealth of relevant
 health information from a pre-integrated dataset, including detailed disease
 descriptions,medication options,precautionary measures,dietary recommendations, 
 and exercise guidelines, all tailored to the predicted conditions.
 The entire workflow is designed to provide users with timely and accurate health
 insights. From symptom entry to the final presentation of results, the system
 operates in real-time, ensuring a smooth user experience. By delivering
 comprehensive health information promptly, the Symptom based disease
 Prediction System empowers users to make informed decisions about their health
 and seek appropriate medical attention when necessary, showcasing the potential
 of machine learning and web technologies in improving healthcare accessibility
 and user engagement.
